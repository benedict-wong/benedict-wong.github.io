          <!-- <p>
          I'm Benedict. I’m a front-end web engineer with a focus in React and WebXR.</p>
          <p>
            I am a engineer whose interests lie in creating and developing high quality interactive experiences for all audiences. In order to do so, my goal is to develop applications where users make immersive and interactive decisions through various mechanics that push the limit of the user's device.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've created many world-class Augmented Reality experiences through working for SFU, 3DParade and Aircards. In these positions, I've explored many different ways to approach WebXR, which is Mixed Reality located through the user's browser without the need to download or install any external programs. I mainly use AFrame as my means of development, as it is quite robust in driving the experiences that I've created for clients. Through AFrame, I've been able to create SLAM-based world tracking experiences, 3D environment experiences and filter-based experiences. Although AFrame is my main approach to development for WebXR, I also have extensive experience in ThreeJS, which help bolster the range in which AFrame's framework doesn't cover. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Most recently, I've taken up ReactJS as an alternative to traditional HTML as React provides a more structured approach to modular component development, something I advocate heavily for when working with projects. I've also begun to experiment with Snapchat's Lens Studio and Camera Kit API as alternatives to WebXR development.
